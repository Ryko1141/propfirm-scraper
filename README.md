# prop-risk-monitor
Prop-Risk Monitor is a Python backend system that continuously monitors prop-firm trading accounts (cTrader-based and expandable to MT5/other APIs) for compliance with firm-specific risk rules. It runs as a long-lived terminal process, polling account data and evaluating live account metrics against a configurable rules engine.
